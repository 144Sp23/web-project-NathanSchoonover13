                    <p>I have had a very traditional education leading up to my career in education as a business teacher. I went to a small high school in North-Central Missouri called Green City R-1, home of the Gophers. I was there from Pre-K to 12th grade, and I graduated within a class of 15 students.</p>

                    <p>Once I graduated from high school I enrolled at <a href="https://www.ncmissouri.edu/">North Central Missouri College</a> in Trenton, Missouri. While attending NCMC, I majored in general education because I did not know what I wanted to get my Bachelor's degree in. NCMC is a very small community college, with a total of only 1,000 to 2,000 students enrolled. Being from a small town, it was a great transition from high school to a bigger university.</p>

                    <p>After I graduated from North Central, I questioned what I wanted to do with my future. I knew I wanted to further my education, but I did not know what field I wanted to study. I searched through different universitys and technical schools trying to find a degree path I wanted. After a lot of searching, I finally made the decision to study business education at <a href="https://www.nwmissouri.edu/">Northwest Missouri State University</a> in Maryville, Missouri. That decision is one of the best of my life and I am forever thankful for my professors at NWMSU. I am super excited to help influence my future classes and students.</p>
