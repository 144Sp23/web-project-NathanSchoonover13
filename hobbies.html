            <p>I have a few different hobbies that I enjoy to do in my free time which include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Golfing</li>
                <li>Hunting and Fishing</li>
                <li>Football</li>
            </ul>

            <p>I started to play golf when I was 9 years old. I got hooked from the very first time I played and ran with it. I would play every day through the summer at my local country club. I would play 27 holes everyday, Monday through Friday while my parents were at work. Today, I will still try to play every weekend during the summers and participate in a few tournaments as well.</p>

            <p>While growing up, my father was a huge outdoorsman and would always take me with him 8879when he would do anything. I was taken duck and deer hunting for the first time at the age of 3. Once I was old enough to start hunting, I was always counting down the days to each opening day for the seasons. When it wasn't hunting season, I would be fishing in the pond across the street or out on our boat. Today, I still act like a kid on christmas everytime deer and turkey season comes around.</p>

            <p>I am a huge football fan and I am obsessed with the Kansas City Chiefs. As a kid, my family would always cheer for the Chiefs every Sunday during the season. I never understood what was going on because I was too young. Once I got into high school, I started to understand the rules of the game and enjoyed just watching football. I was always a big Payton Manning fan, even when he was a Bronco. Once he retired, I was finally at the age to understand that I wanted my state to win so I became a bigger KC fan. Today, I try to go to 1 game each year with my girlfriend. We were at the AFC Championship this year when they won against the Bengals. That was one of the most fun experiences of my life!</p>/
